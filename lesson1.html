            <ol id="fontcolor">
                <li>First, beat the egg whites to firm peaks. The tips should fall but the base of the meringue should hold its shape.</li>
                <li>Next, beat the egg yolks, sugar, salt, vanilla, honey, and water together until pale yellow and fluffy. Gradually increase to high speed for best results.</li>
                <li>Combine half the egg whites with the egg yolk mixture and gently fold being careful not to deflate any of the egg whites or egg yolk mixture.</li>
                <li>Sift in the cake flour and baking powder and fold gently. Next add the vegetable oil. Tip: To help incorporate the oil, first mix in a bit of batter with the oil. Then add to the remaining batter.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining half of the egg whites and gently fold together.</li>
                <li>Pour into a six inch cake pan lined with parchment paper and bake at 350 degrees F until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            </ol>
